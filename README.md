### 🌃​ Nightly-build 🌃​

[Click here](./nightly-build/) to see the nightly-build.

<details> <summary> What is a nightly-build? 🤔​ </summary>

In software development, a nightly-build is:

```
A version generated automatically each night from the latest code—often unstable.
```

In Cheerfulism, this works as a saved snapshot of the next version I’m writing. I upload updates from time to time, new ideas, questions, or notes without worrying about order or coherence.

It serves two purposes:

- To track the evolution of the book’s ideas and writing.  
- To keep a backup of the current state of the book and my thoughts in case anything happens to the main files or to my life.
