## Nightly-build 🌃​

In software development, the nightly-build version of a code is:

```
A version generated automatically every night from the latest code. Often unstable.
```

In Cheerfulism, here I save as a copy the current state of the next version I'm writing.

Every now and then I upload new changes, with additions of new ideas, questions or wahtever to the text. Not really in a neccessarily conherent or ordered way.

The functions it serves are two:

- Have a better tracking of the development of ideas and writings in the book.
- Have a backup copy of the current state of the book and my ideas, in case something happens to my main files or my human life.
